Necromancy in Kelrûn
The Essence of Necromancy
Necromancy in Kelrûn is not merely the reanimation of the dead—it is the art of breaking the Veil, the sacred barrier between life and death.
Before the first necromancer's ritual, death was a journey and magic was a harmony. But when the First Necromancer shattered the Veil, magic itself changed.
Now, necromancy is a corruptive force, twisting the world and those who dare wield it.

It is not simply a spell, but a contagion.

Necromancy feeds on grief, rage, and desire for power.

Its glyphs burn, scar, and taint everything they touch.

How Necromancy Works
Glyphs and Rituals:
Necromancy is cast using forbidden runes—glyphs scrawled in blood, bone dust, or ash. These symbols channel the “echoes” of the broken Veil, forcing lost souls or animating corpses by binding them to the caster’s will.

Mana and Corruption:
Drawing upon necromantic mana is always a bargain. It taints the land, drains color from stone and flesh, and infuses everything nearby with a sense of dread and wrongness.

Summoning and Transformation:
The most powerful necromancers can summon not just the dead, but twist the living—warping bodies and minds into new, horrifying shapes.

How Necromancy Warped Kelrûn
1. Landscape
Forests wither, rivers run black, and once-bright cities become nests of rot and silence.

Fields of flowers become graveyards of bone-blossoms.

Even the air feels colder, heavier, and smells faintly of decay.

2. Twisting the Living
Necromancy does not always kill—it transforms.

Flesh-Warping:
Humans exposed to deep necromancy may sprout bone spurs, rot alive, or fuse with dead matter. Eyes melt and reform. Skin sloughs off to reveal runic scars.

Soul Binding:
Some are turned into Hollow, their memories stolen and their voices lost, forced to serve their new masters in silence.

Madness and Mutation:
Prolonged exposure warps the mind: victims hear the voices of the dead, forget their own names, or become obsessed with pain, fire, or hunger.

Birth of Monsters:
The most tragic cases are those who sought forbidden power and became the first Gorebound monsters, Swarm behemoths, or Gravewrought wraiths—grotesque, tormented, and neither living nor dead.

Atmospheric Details
In necromantic zones, shadows lengthen and move strangely.

Mirrors reflect faces that are not your own.

Colors fade—even sunlight seems weaker.

The earth itself becomes uneasy: stones shift, water pools with strange iridescence, birds and animals flee or sicken.

Societal Impact
Fear and suspicion taint every community.

Families watch each other for signs of corruption: feverish eyes, unnatural strength, or the whispering of forbidden glyphs in their sleep.

The Dawnflame Order burns not only corpses but homes, fields, and even survivors to prevent the spread.

Lasting Legacy
Necromancy did more than break the cycle of death—it unmade beauty, hope, and trust.
Even those who fight against the undead sometimes find themselves marked by the same power they despise.
In Kelrûn, all magic changed after the Veil’s fall—but none so terribly as the magic of death.
Necromancy Spellcasting in Kelrûn
The Tools of the Art
Even after the Veil’s fall, the practice of magic in Kelrûn remains complex and deeply ritualized—especially necromancy. While glyphs and rituals are still essential, powerful spellcasters channel their will through grimoires, staves, wands, and bare hands.

Spellbooks (Grimoires)
The most dangerous and coveted objects in Kelrûn.

Bound in strange hide, their pages filled with shifting glyphs, blood-ink, and curses.

Each necromantic grimoire is unique; many are sentient, whispering secrets or demanding prices from their readers.

Reading from such a book can warp the mind, curse the body, or summon spirits that linger even after the cover is closed.

Staffs and Wands
Carved from bone, gravewood, or iron salvaged from ruined sanctuaries.

Used to channel necromantic energy with greater precision, reducing (but never eliminating) the personal risk.

Staffs can store necromantic glyphs and be “triggered” in battle to unleash waves of rot, silence, or cold flame.

Wands are more subtle, often used for curses, controlling minor undead, or inscribing glyphs at a distance.

Hand Gestures and Spoken Words
Many necromancers wield power directly through hands, blood, and voice.

Gestures are precise—twisting fingers in the shape of ancient runes.

Words must be spoken in the true language of the Veil, often at risk of attracting attention from spirits or hostile magic.

How Spellcasting Works
Preparation

Study the glyphs (in books, on staff, or from memory).

Prepare components: bone dust, grave-ash, sacrificial blood, or rare herbs.

Draw the glyph or speak the words, focusing power through the chosen tool.

Channeling

Magic flows from the caster into the Veil and back, drawing the attention of nearby spirits or echoes.

The spell is shaped by intent, but the Veil’s corruption always fights back—sometimes twisting the result.

Consequences

Failed spells can result in madness, mutation, or the accidental raising of something far worse than expected.

Overuse causes physical changes: blackened veins, cold skin, eyes that reflect only darkness, and, in time, whispers from beyond.


Magic and Necromancy in Kelrûn
Magic in Everyday Life
In the age before the Veil’s shattering—and even in the scattered strongholds of the present—magic is woven into daily life.

Wands are used by artisans, teachers, healers, and guardians.

Spellbooks (grimoires) are kept in family libraries, filled with spells for light, healing, growth, and simple protections.

Staffs serve as symbols of office, tools for focusing weather magic, mending, or warding against misfortune.

Rituals and runes decorate homes and public squares, blessing harvests, guiding lost travelers, or marking sacred days.

Magic is a craft, an art, and a heritage—respected, but not inherently feared.

Necromancy: The Forbidden Path
Necromancy, however, is the exception.

It was always a rare and dangerous art, barely tolerated even in ancient times.

Since the Veil was shattered, necromancy has become a curse on the land, feared by all and outlawed wherever civilization survives.

Why Necromancy Is Different
Its runes are warped, hungry things, feeding on suffering and loss.

Spellbooks of necromancy whisper, bleed, or shift their own glyphs when closed.

Wands and staffs carved for necromancy radiate cold, black light, and are often found slick with an oily residue.

Necromancers warp the world around them: plants die, food spoils, and living things grow thin and pale.

Casting Necromancy
Still uses books, staffs, wands, or hands—but every tool becomes tainted when used for necromantic purposes.

The user is always marked: by changing eyes, chilling skin, whispers, or worse.

Even if a “normal” spellcaster tries necromancy once, it stains their aura, and others can sense the wrongness.

Cultural and Social Divide
Healers, mages, and scholars are honored in most communities.

Necromancers are hunted, exiled, or burned.

Dawnflame Order and other factions make no distinction: even suspected necromancy is a death sentence.

Black markets do exist, selling forbidden tomes and relics to those desperate or arrogant enough to risk it.

The Monstrous Artistry of Kelrûn’s Necromancers
Mastery Over Undeath
In Kelrûn, necromancy is a spectrum—ranging from desperate dabblers, to medium-tier spellcasters who can raise corpses from shallow graves, all the way to the high-tier necromancers, who are as much creators as they are destroyers.

Custom-Built Horrors
The greatest necromancers are more than simple corpse-raisers. They are artists of death, able to sculpt and design their own minions from flesh, bone, shadow, and raw hate.

Monstrous Creations:
High-tier necromancers can assemble abominations never seen in nature:

Armored hulks with six arms made for tearing.

Plaguebeasts stitched together from wolves, men, and carrion birds.

Bone golems built from the skeletons of a dozen species, runes carved into every rib.

Flesh-moths, winged nightmares spun from the skin of the fallen.

Swamp titans, enormous undead bred to swim through bogs or tear down city walls.

Personal Legions:
Each high necromancer has a signature “style”—one may favor beasts dripping with rot and fungus, another may build silent, spectral knights, another might create living sculptures of agony in homage to the Gorebound.

Intelligent Servants:
They can bind ghosts, spirits, and the souls of the dead into new forms, forcing old enemies to serve as advisors, spies, or even lieutenants in their monstrous armies.

World-Spanning Summoning
One of the most terrifying abilities of Kelrûn’s elite necromancers is their reach—their power is not limited to the battlefield before them.

Anywhere, Anytime:
High-tier necromancers can sense death across the world: the unquiet dead beneath distant mountains, the plague-killed in foreign swamps, the restless ghosts lurking beneath city stones.

Command Over Distance:
With a single gesture—a pointed finger, a drawn glyph in the air—they can call forth undead or monsters from beneath any surface:

Skeletons clawing up from tile floors in a city hall.

Rot-beasts surging from the mud in the heart of a living forest.

Corpses rising from shallow lakes or even bursting through stone in old fortresses.

Summoning Beasts:
Medium and high-tier necromancers can also reach into the bestial world of death: summoning zombie wolves, plague crows, skeletal bears, or new monsters of their own invention to hunt, guard, or sow terror.

Effortless Power
Medium-tier necromancers can often raise lesser undead—zombies, ghouls, or skeletal animals—simply by pointing and muttering a word, their spells riding the scent of blood and rot.

High-tier necromancers need not even speak. A gesture, a glance, a wave of the staff or wand, and the dead obey.

Atmospheric Example
“With a silent gesture, the Bone Court’s arch-necromancer traced a spiral in the air.
Beneath the marble streets of Solace, coffins shuddered, cracked, and burst open. Skeletal hands clawed for daylight, and the market square was filled with the sudden stench of death.
Across the city, a statue groaned as flesh seeped from its eyes, pooling at its feet to form a new, misshapen horror—custom-made to obey its creator’s whispered will.”

Why the World Fears Them
No wall is safe, no city untouchable. With the greatest necromancers of Kelrûn still at large, any place where death has left a mark is vulnerable.
Each new horror is a signature, a challenge, and a promise:
As long as the Veil remains broken, the world itself is their canvas.
