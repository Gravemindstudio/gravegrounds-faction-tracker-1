Gorebound Legion
"Pain is the only prayer the dead still hear."
Origin
When the First Necromancer's scream shattered the Veil, some dead rose hungry - not for life, but for
suffering.
From battlefields and plague-pits, they clawed upward. They did not rebuild. They punished.
Thus was born the Gorebound Legion.
Marnok, the First Gorelord, stood at their heart - a living wound, his chest cracked open, his heart beating
blackly, speaking in chains of command etched into flesh.
Philosophy
The Gorebound believed:
- Pain is purity.
- Suffering is worship.
- Death is a shallow kindness.
They harvested agony. They crafted monuments out of misery.
Aggression and Warfare
The Gorebound Legion is never passive.
They move from city to city, village to village, hunting the living, capturing them alive, dragging them back to
camps of endless cruelty.
Their armies strike without warning:
- Swarming over walls in the dead of night.
- Tunneling under defenses.
- Sowing confusion before blood is ever spilled.
Once defenders are broken, they are captured, not killed.
Capturing and Torture
Survivors are:

- Stripped, branded, and chained.
- Children forced to watch families tortured.
- Warriors broken, their nerves enchanted to heighten pain.
Pain is the harvest. The Legion savors it.
Their camps are:
- Living altars.
- Blood reliquaries.
- Rituals of endless, harvested suffering.
Weapons of Pain
The Gorebound forge tools of cruelty:
- Flesh-hooks to rip meat.
- Serrated sabers to tear and splatter.
- Whips of sinew.
- Nailcage maces embedding nails into flesh.
Even arrows are barbed to ignite nerves on impact.
How They Kill Humans
They capture. They torture. They enslave suffering.
- Civilians herded into pens.
- Wounded soldiers kept alive for months.
- Commanders flayed alive and turned into maps.
Their cities become orchards of pain.
Environment and Atmosphere
Gorebound lands bleed:
- Rivers thick with blood.
- Trees hanging with corpses.
- Mountains paved in bone.
Their camps are fields of broken dreams:
- Roads paved with kneecaps.

- Fountains of bile.
- Thrones of spine and tendon.
Sieges and Battles
When they besiege:
- They capture survivors first.
- Turn them into weapons.
- Send mutilated victims back to break enemy morale.
They do not conquer. They corrupt.
They do not occupy. They violate.
Their victories are marked by broken minds, not banners.

The Gorebound Legion
"Pain is the only prayer the dead still hear."

Origin
When the First Necromancer’s scream shattered the Veil, not all the dead rose seeking life. Some clawed from their graves hungry—not for rebirth, but for suffering.
From the battlefields and plague-pits, the first of the Gorebound Legion emerged.
They did not rebuild. They punished.

At their center was Marnok, the First Gorelord—a living wound, chest cracked open, black heart beating, his commands etched into the flesh of his followers with chains and agony.

Philosophy
Pain is purity.

Suffering is worship.

Death is a shallow kindness.

For the Gorebound, agony is the highest devotion. They do not seek conquest or power; they harvest suffering and craft monuments of misery in blood and bone.

Warfare and Aggression
The Legion is never passive; it is a storm that moves from city to city, village to village.

They hunt the living, always capturing survivors alive—dragging them back to camps of endless cruelty.

Their attacks are sudden and relentless:

Swarming over walls in the dead of night

Tunneling under defenses

Sowing confusion before the first blood is spilled

Once defenders are broken, they are captured, not killed.

Capturing and Torture
Survivors are stripped, branded, and chained.

Children are forced to watch families tortured.

Warriors are broken, nerves enchanted to heighten pain.

Pain is the harvest. The Legion savors it.

Their camps are:

Living altars

Blood reliquaries

Rituals of endless, harvested suffering

Weapons of Pain
The Gorebound’s weapons are designed for cruelty:

Flesh-hooks for ripping meat

Serrated sabers to tear and splatter

Whips of sinew

Nailcage maces, studded with rusted nails

Even arrows are barbed to ignite pain on impact

How They Kill Humans
Civilians herded into pens

Wounded soldiers kept alive for months of agony

Commanders flayed and turned into living maps

Their cities become orchards of pain.

Environment and Atmosphere
In lands held by the Gorebound:

Rivers run thick with blood

Trees hang with corpses

Mountains are paved with bone

Their camps are fields of broken dreams:

Roads paved with kneecaps

Fountains of bile

Thrones made of spine and tendon

Sieges and Battles
The Legion captures survivors first, then turns them into weapons.

They send mutilated victims back to break enemy morale.

They do not conquer—they corrupt.

They do not occupy—they violate.

Their victories are marked not by banners, but by broken minds.

Methods of Torture
Pain as Worship
To the Gorebound Legion, torture is not simply punishment—it is ritual, devotion, and art. Every victim is an offering, every scream a hymn to the broken Veil. Suffering is harvested, not wasted, and the dead find meaning only in pain’s purity.

Capture and Preparation
The Hunt:
Gorebound forces capture the living with care, avoiding fatal wounds. Prisoners are bound in chains etched with necromantic runes that amplify sensation and block all hope of numbness.

Branding and Marking:
Victims are branded with the Legion’s sigil: a flayed wound, often across the chest or back. Some are forced to carry written messages—“meat for the Gorelord,” “heretic to be broken”—scarred onto their flesh.

Torture Chambers and Camps
A Gorebound camp is a living altar:

Pits lined with barbed chains where captives hang by wrists and ankles for days, each movement reopening wounds.

Wooden racks carved with glyphs that turn pain into a faint, glowing mist, harvested and inhaled by Legion necromancers.

Sound amplifiers made from horn and bone that echo every scream across the camp, to be heard and savored by all.

Signature Methods
1. Flesh-Hooking
Victims are suspended by barbed hooks sunk into muscle—never through bone, so the suffering is constant but survivable.
Hooks are moved daily to fresh wounds. Some prisoners are kept alive for months, rotating from one hook to the next, each day’s agony carefully monitored and escalated.

2. Nerve-Binding
Enchanted wire or sinew is wrapped tightly around nerves in the arms, legs, or face. This amplifies every sensation, making even a whisper of wind across the skin feel like burning.
Gorebound surgeons can adjust the bindings to bring a victim to the edge of madness, but never quite let them fall into shock.

3. Flaying and Skin-Grafting
Commanders and defiant prisoners are slowly flayed alive. Strips of skin are carved off in ritual patterns, the wounds painted with salt and necromantic oil to keep them raw but uninfected.
Sometimes, skin is sewn onto other victims—branding them with the pain of another.

4. Branded Maps
High-ranking foes are turned into living maps:

Flayed, then tattooed with symbols and paths using acid-dipped needles.

Kept alive by forced healing magic, they are displayed during battle, a lesson and a warning to all who resist.

5. The Nailcage
A favored device for warriors and heroes:

Victims are forced into a cage of rusted iron, inside which dozens of sharpened nails are positioned at random angles.

Any movement drives nails into new flesh, but immobility is equally torturous, as the cage is slowly heated or tilted, forcing pain to find them.

Some cages are enchanted to hum with ghostly voices—taunting, mocking, reminding the captive of lost loved ones.

6. The Orchard of Knees
Prisoners’ kneecaps are removed, and the captives are forced to crawl through fields of gravel and bone. These “orchards” line the roads to Gorebound camps, and survivors are made to watch the suffering as they are dragged past.

7. The Fountains of Bile
Some prisoners are fed a steady diet of poison and filth, only to have their stomachs pumped and the bile collected into grotesque fountains at the camp’s center. To be forced to drink from these fountains is a punishment reserved for traitors or failed spies.

8. The Chorus of Agony
Groups of captives are linked by sinew cords through their tongues or limbs, their nerves magically entwined so that when one screams, all feel it.
The Legion’s necromancers “conduct” this chorus, using pain as both spectacle and source of power.

9. Child Witnesses
The Gorebound often keep children alive specifically to force them to witness the torture of parents and siblings. Sometimes, the Legion will coerce children to participate—handing them the whip or knife, turning innocence into another wound to be exploited.

Purpose and Legacy
The Legion tortures not just for information or terror, but because pain is their creed.

Those who survive become forever marked—physically, mentally, and spiritually. Many join the Hollow Redeemed, seeking penance; others become broken, hollow shadows of themselves.

Every rumor of a Gorebound camp, every story of a “Pain Orchard,” is enough to send entire villages fleeing in terror.

Atmosphere
When the wind blows from the east, some in Solace claim to hear distant screaming, echoing over the hills—proof that somewhere, the Gorebound are at work.



Gravewrought Court
"A throne does not rot. It endures."
Origin
When the First Necromancer's scream shattered the Veil, kings wept, priests prayed, and armies died.
But the nobles of Viremyr - the ancient bloodlines, the crowned monarchs, the high priests - did not weep.
They listened.
They saw the scream not as a curse, but as a coronation.
Death had always been their greatest fear.
Now, death had been broken.
The nobles of Viremyr would not simply survive it. They would master it.
Thus rose the Gravewrought Court - a kingdom of liches, vampires, soulbinders, and eternal kings.
A court where power is measured in centuries. Where bloodlines never end - only change.
Where the living exist only to serve until their flesh and spirit are consumed for the Court's feasts.
Philosophy
"A throne does not rot. It endures."
This is their creed.
They believe death is a natural evolution - but life must be chained to serve the eternal blood.
Their nobility must be preserved forever.
They view the First Necromancer as The Eternal Sovereign - the one who defied the decay of time.
They do not worship him. They believe they inherit his crown.
Life to them is currency. Souls are tribute. Suffering is taxation.
The Gravewrought Court does not rage. It rules.
Necromancer-Lords and Houses
The Court is made up of ancient Houses, each ruled by a Necromancer-Lord:
- Bloodbound Counts who drink the souls of their subjects through ritual feasts.
- Lich-Kings who wear entire kingdoms as phylacteries.
- Duchesses of Bone whose whispers can erode a man's mind across battlefields.
- Knight-Errants made of stitched flesh and iron vows.

Their living descendants are bred carefully:
- Children are soulbound at birth.
- Bloodlines are "groomed" through dark alchemy.
- Marriages are arranged not for love, but for binding power to blood.
The Gravewrought Court does not need armies. It needs subjects. It needs memory.
How They Kill Humans
The Gravewrought Court kills beautifully.
They do not swarm villages like beasts. They do not scream like mindless dead.
They arrive in silence, in gilded carriages pulled by eyeless horses, in retinues of skeletal guards adorned with
silk and gold.
They offer choices. They offer treaties. They offer deals.
Accept, and you may live - for a time - in gilded servitude. You will feast on rot and drink memory.
Reject, and:
- Your blood is harvested drop by drop.
- Your soul is tethered to an iron casket and paraded in shame.
- Your body is broken, reshaped into a servitor to wait upon the Court forever.
The Court does not leave behind ruins.
It leaves behind palaces of the dead - full of weeping ghosts, groveling revenants, and the smiles of kings who
will never rot.
Atmosphere
Their citadels are black marble and crimson banners.
Their streets glow with ghost-light.
Their air is cold, perfumed with grave dust and old incense.
Music plays in endless ballrooms - instruments plucked by skeletal hands, dances waltzed by bodies that do
not bleed anymore.
Where the Gravewrought Court reigns:
- Hope is a myth.
- Loyalty is bred.

- Death is a beginning, not an end.

Hollow Redeemed
"We do not forget our sins. We carry them."
Origin
There was a time when they were the worst monsters the world had ever known.
They were the Gorebound Legion - butchers, torturers, devourers of the living.
Then one of them, Sorrow, remembered what it meant to be human.
When Marnok ordered the slaughter of an orphan monastery to forge "songs of agony," Sorrow rebelled.
He shattered the bloodbound glyphs. He slew Marnok. He burned the banners stitched from human faces.
Those who survived followed him into exile.
They buried their old name. They buried their old crimes.
They called themselves the Hollow Redeemed.
Philosophy
Redemption is not a prize. It is a burden.
The Hollow Redeemed do not seek forgiveness.
They fight because they must.
They do not fight for glory. They do not fight for power.
They fight because if they do not, they are monsters who forgot how to weep.
Structure and Necromancy
The Hollow Redeemed still use necromancy - but to protect, not conquer.
- Shieldbearers: skeletons reforged with iron and runes of protection.
- Soulbound Guardians: spirits in armor sacrificing themselves.
- Mournwrights: necromancers who weave barriers of sorrow.
Their glyphs hum with sorrow, not hatred.

Each summoned protector bears names of the forgotten.
How They Treat Humans
They do not harm the living.
They stand between humans and death, even when scorned.
They accept the hatred. They accept the blame.
They heal the wounded. They repair the broken. They suffer first.
Environment and Atmosphere
Where they travel:
- Air grows heavy.
- Wind carries half-dug prayers.
They wear ashes. Their banners are stitched with the names of the dead.
Their camps bring rest. Their fortresses are places where crops grow from graves.
Tactics and Warfare
They never strike first.
- Shieldwalls of the dead.
- Spirit barriers absorb spells.
- Bone wards collapse to protect others.
They know they will lose.
But they stand anyway.
Because sometimes redemption is not winning.
It is simply not falling again.

The Hollow Redeemed: A Day in Unlife
1. The Awakening
They do not sleep, not as the living do.
At sunset, a Hollow Redeemed rises from where it rested—kneeling in a field, standing under a ruined arch, or slumped against a stone. There is no breath, no muttered prayer, only motion. Sometimes, in the moment between dusk and true night, old memories flicker behind sightless eyes: a harvest, a family, a name. The moment passes. Duty remains.

2. Patrol
The Hollow Redeemed walk the borders and roads in pairs, never speaking.
Their movements are measured, precise.
If a lantern gutters out in the dark, one pauses to relight it, using a flint it keeps tied at its waist.
If a fence has been broken by wind or beast, the Redeemed mend it—splitting old boards with inhuman strength, binding them silently with cord.
The farmers watch from their windows, eyes wary, doors bolted tight.

3. The Accusation
Sometimes, a mob gathers—angry after a poor harvest, fearful after a child is found sick, or simply hateful on a hungry night.
A Hollow Redeemed is cornered near a market, stones thrown, curses spat. It stands motionless. A child hides behind its tattered cloak, but the Redeemed does not shield itself; instead, it gently guides the child away, then kneels, offering its back to the blows.
It does not defend itself.
It does not run.
When the beating is done, it rises if it can. If not, another Redeemed will drag the broken shell away at dawn.

4. Memory
The Hollow Redeemed remember everything—each kindness, each cruelty, every life they took before their turning, every insult endured after.
They cannot speak these memories, so they carve them:

Small runes etched into hidden stones at the edge of fields.

Names scratched into the wood of fallen trees.

Symbols painted in ash on the inside of ruined walls, seen only by those who know to look.

5. The Lost and the Saved
Children lost in fog sometimes return, led by a cold hand, never seeing the face of their savior.
A wounded animal is left at a doorstep, its wounds already cleaned and bound.
On the night of a great attack, it is the Redeemed who form a silent wall between the invaders and the town, taking wounds that would have killed the living.

6. Rituals of the Redeemed
They do not pray, but sometimes gather in old graveyards.
There, they stand in a circle, each holding a stone or a bone, and trace patterns in the earth with their fingers.
Some believe they are mourning. Others say they are remembering the dead—both those they once were and those they failed to save.

7. Regret
If a Redeemed is seen watching a family from afar, it is never for hunger or threat.
It is memory, longing, or simply the pain of knowing they can never again be part of what they protect.

8. Final Rest
When a Redeemed is destroyed—whether by mob, by monster, or by time—others gather its remains and carry them beyond the city, burying them with care and marking the spot with an unadorned stone.
No words are spoken, but a feeling lingers: sorrow, gratitude, or perhaps, at last, a small measure of peace.

Fragments of Thought
Occasionally, a glyph-scribe claims to have read the “thoughts” of a Redeemed through runes left behind. They are simple, repetitive, and heartbreaking:

Protect.

Remember.

No forgiveness.

I am sorry.

Stand the watch.

Never again.

Swarm of the Mireborn
"You bury one. We birth a thousand."
Origin
When the Veil shattered, the world bled. And where that blood seeped into the earth - the Swarm was born.
It began in the low places. In the mires. In the forgotten graves. In the plague-pits no priest dared to sanctify.
The first were accidents:
- A drowned child splitting open with a clutch of chittering larvae.
- A battlefield rotting into a nest of bone-wasps and flesh-flies.
No necromancer had cast spells here. The Veil's breaking had awakened the decay itself. And it remembered
how to hunger.
The Rotmother
She does not rule. She gestates.
Buried deep in the belly of the Mirefang Swamps, a rotted mound of flesh the size of a cathedral heaves with
every breath.
Her skin is veined with black eggs. Her mouth is a ruin of teeth and birthing ducts.
From her, the Swarm flows: Larvae. Rotborn. Fleshbeasts. Each a prayer to the god she knows only as The
First Necromancer - the one who taught the world how to die wrongly.
She does not speak. Her will is carried on hive-psalms sung in chittering tongues by her spawn.
Necromancers  The Mirelords
The Swarm is not mindless. It is guided by the Mirelords - necromancers twisted into communion with the
Rotmother's hive-mind.
Some were human once:
- Sorcerers who, in despair or madness, offered their flesh to the mire.
- Warlords who sought immortality and found infection instead.
Others were born directly from the Rotmothers dreams - larva-shaped necromancers, grown from stillborn

corpses and birthed screaming arcane plague.
Their necromancy is not clean. It is organic, rotting, alive.
They cast spells not with words, but with bile, blood, and the squirming scripts of disease.
Mirelords can:
- Warp corpses into swarming siege-creatures.
- Sow entire fields with plague glyphs that hatch into carnivorous moss.
- Summon tide-hives of flesh-wasps to strip armies to bone in hours.
- Weave hexes of hunger and madness, causing defenders to devour their own kin.
Their magic stinks of decay. It festers in the ground long after they have moved on.
How They Kill Humans
The Swarm does not simply kill. It recycles.
- Soldiers are dragged into the muck and implanted with hatch-broods.
- Villagers are infested with worm-seed, causing their bodies to birth new horrors.
- Priests and generals are spiked to trees, their still-living corpses used to broadcast hive-songs to lure others
in.
The living are not enemies. They are material.
Every death is a birth. Every grave is a cradle.
The Swarm does not fight fair. It fights biologically. It out-breeds, out-rots, outlasts.
Environment and Atmosphere
The territories of the Swarm are impossible to cleanse.
- The trees weep pus.
- The rivers thicken with hatch-flesh.
- The air buzzes with the wings of unborn things.
Villages fall without battles.
First the wells are tainted. Then the grain is seeded with plague. Then the infants cry with two mouths.

By the time an army marches into the Mireborns lands, they are already dead. They just don't know it yet.
Tactics and Warfare
The Swarm spreads by infection and inevitability.
- Tunnel under cities.
- Seed plague glyphs in aqueducts.
- Send fleshbeast nests to burst inside walls.
- Hatch mirror-armies of corrupted defenders inside enemy camps.
Their sieges do not last months. They last generations - until no walls stand, no fields yield food, and the
survivors beg to die.
They do not break kingdoms. They digest them.

Swarm of the Mireborn – Complete Lore
Origin
When the Veil shattered, the world bled. And where that blood seeped into the earth – the Swarm was
born. It began in the low places: the mires, forgotten graves, and plague-pits no priest dared to sanctify.

The living are not enemies. They are material. Every death is a birth. Every grave is a cradle.
Additional horrors described include Rot Worms burrowing inside the living until nerves collapse and
organs fail, and Bog Beasts dragging prey underwater to drown them before implanting larvae. The
Mireborn prefer infection first and death later, spreading plague and rot before consuming what
remains. Their methods deny peace, ensuring that death is a transformation rather than an end.

GraveGrounds: The Seven Necromancer Legends
General Skarn  The Gravefather (Bone March)
Skarn rose not with fury, but with structure. He does not command - he compels. His silent will pulls corpses
into formation like gravity. No voice, no soul - just endless motion. Skarn marches, and death obeys.
Ashen Pyrexis  The Flame That No Longer Breathes (Cult of the Withered Flame)
Born in a furnace of agony, Pyrexis is not a leader - he is a firestorm given form. His magic ignites memory,
language, even the sky. Where he walks, the faithful burn, and the world melts beneath his pain.
Virelith the Eternal  Voice of the Blood Throne (Gravewrought Court)
Crowned in a tomb, Virelith's blood is her dominion. Her voice is memory. Her necromancy seeps from
ancient veins and compels all lineage to kneel. She does not lead. She inherits. And all things will be hers in
time.
Rotmother  The Unbirthed Queen (Swarm of the Mireborn)
She gestates spells in her womb and coughs contagion into the sky. Her hive-mind births necromancy through
infection, reproduction, and endless biological corruption. She is not a caster - she is a living spell factory.
Maelrith the Stillborn  Choirmaster of Silence (Choir of Silence)
Born erasure, Maelrith is memory made extinct. He does not speak - he conducts silence. His magic
dismantles language, identity, and thought. Entire cities are forgotten just by hearing his name.
Sorrow  The One Who Turned Away (Hollow Redeemed)
Once a butcher, now a mourner. Sorrow's magic is grief-powered necromancy. He does not command the dead
- he carries them. Each spell is a name. Each defense, an apology. He fights so no one else will die as they did.
Inquisitor Varaxis  The Last Torch (Dawnflame Order)
No magic. No forgiveness. Just fire. Varaxis has burned the dead and the living alike to keep the last pyre lit.
His sword is doctrine. His armor is sacrifice. And when all hope fails, he will still be burning.
