Bone March
BONE MARCH
I. The Unbroken March
The Bone March is relentless, but not mindless. Its armies do not wander aimlessly or pass like a plague of
locusts. Their movement is the world's new law:
Columns of the dead forge roads where none existed. Legions cross mountains and mires, carve bone bridges
over ravines, or tunnel through ruined hillsides. They do not stop for seasons or weather; snow piles atop
helmets, dust fills empty sockets, but the march goes on.
Sometimes the March halts for weeks or months, setting up grim encampments that become permanent scars
upon the land. The March is not a single army, but hundreds of legions, sometimes converging, sometimes
diverging, their paths forming a lattice of haunted roads that blot out the old map of Kelrun.
When obstacles rise-a chasm, a river, a ruined city-the Bone March simply flows over, through, or beneath.
Their movement carves scars into the earth that never heal.
II. Occupation: Outposts, Citadels, and Undead Cities
Wherever the March pauses, it leaves behind more than desolation:
Outposts
Quickly-raised bastions made of fused bone, scavenged iron, and debris from shattered villages. Garrisoned by
skeletal sentinels, bone-hounds, or silent archers whose bows never decay. These serve as watchposts,
waystations, and points of terror, ensuring no living army or rebel can pass unnoticed.
Occupation & Guarding
The dead do not simply march onward; they guard what they conquer. Entire battalions patrol former cities,
ruined bridges, and crossroads, maintaining an eerie order. Necromancer-Lords assign favored horrors to
oversee these conquests: Bone Wardens, Ironbound Sergeants, spirit-bound ravens.
Undead Cities
Some outposts grow into necropolises-true undead cities. Citadels rise: fortresses of ribcages, towers of
mortared skulls, barracks lined with the armor and faces of the defeated. These cities are centers of
necromantic experimentation, black politics, and ceaseless recruitment. The living avoid these places, for the
air itself is thick with command, memory, and the endless shuffle of bone. In the heart of these cities,
Necromancer-Lords preside over courts of the dead, breeding new monstrosities, conducting experiments, and
sending orders to distant legions.
Old trade roads are now bone causeways, patrolled day and night by deathless watchmen. Ancient temples and
castles are refitted as barracks or laboratories for the construction of abominations. Even the living, captured
and enslaved, are sometimes forced to work as corpse-tenders or grave-diggers, until their strength fails and
they join the ranks they once feared.
III. The Ways of the Bone March

Bone March
Columns of bone and iron snake endlessly across the land, crossing rivers, wading through ruins, grinding
down mountainsides by sheer mass and repetition. The March's presence changes more than the land-it warps
the very idea of civilization: new necropolises serve as dread capitals, broadcasting the power and reach of the
Necromancer-Lords. Each undead city and fortress has its own black banners, symbols carved in marrow, and
rituals of remembrance-ensuring the Bone March's legacy is not just movement, but occupation.
Messages travel by spectral couriers or bone-carved ravens, ensuring no intrusion, rebellion, or human plot
goes unnoticed. Outposts report to citadels; citadels answer to the Court of Skarn and his chosen Lords.
IV. Bone Harvests and "The Picking"
Periodically, the March slows and Necromancer-Lords conduct the Picking-a grim culling and renewal.
Damaged or depleted units are gathered and broken down. Bones are reforged into new shapes; shattered
armor and steel are melted and hammered into monstrous siege engines. Every battlefield, every massacre,
every graveyard passed is harvested. The dead are never left behind. Flesh is stripped, souls are bound,
memories stolen and woven into banners or relics of command.
The Picking sites become dead zones. No green returns. Birds fall silent. Even spirits avoid these places,
feeling only hunger and dread in the air.
V. Experimentation and Atrocities
Within citadels, Necromancer-Lords and their bone-engineers pursue endless, pitiless experimentation:
New forms of undead are created-Bonemelds stitched from many, Memory Leeches that hunt the minds of the
living, siege-beasts bred for new horrors. Failed experiments are not discarded-they are unleashed, set loose to
clear paths through wildlands or hunt down those who attempt escape.
No two fortresses are alike. Each is a monument to a Lord's particular obsession-spires of fused femurs,
battlements that scream with embedded souls, gates that breathe cold mist.
VI. The Black Hierarchy
The Bone March has its own politics, but mercy and forgiveness do not exist among the dead.
Necromancer-Lords vie for favor, resources, and the right to lead the next major siege. Ambition is measured
by the scale of atrocity, the ingenuity of horror, and the obedience of one's legions.
Betrayal does happen-rival Lords may send their enemies into doomed assaults, or engineer failures to
consume more resources for themselves. Skarn, the Gravefather, rules with absolute, wordless authority. None
challenge his purpose. All serve the continuation of the March.
VII. The Rhythm of War and Rest
The Bone March does not always advance. When the call for a new campaign comes, the legions mobilize,
rising from their crypts and marching columns rejoin the main host. Between wars, they strengthen their
holdings: fortifying walls, patrolling dead roads, and conducting harvests among the ruins.

Bone March
There are tales of human survivors who return to lost cities, only to find them transformed-coldly ordered,
stripped of color, guarded by tireless sentinels who remember every fallen enemy.
VIII. The Land After the March
Where the March passes, nothing is left unchanged. Farmland is trampled to bone-dust. Rivers are dammed by
corpses. Forests are stripped bare, their roots wrenched up to make way for marching columns. Villages are
ground into ruin, their dead harvested, their buildings pulled down for war material or simply erased.
Sometimes, cryptic markers remain-bone totems, banners stitched from skin, skulls etched with the names of
conquered cities-a warning to the living that the March leaves nothing behind.
IX. Rituals of Deathless Purpose
The Raising
Before great battles, all ranks gather for the Raising, lifting their deadest dead-the oldest bones, the most
storied skulls-for silent veneration.
Necromancer-Lords gather to rebind the glyphs that hold their power, etching new runes in marrow and blood.
Night of Silence
Once every cycle, the March halts at the same moment, wherever they are, and stands motionless in the dark.
This is the Night of Silence-remembrance not of mercy, but of the scream that began their endless duty.
X. Infiltration and Subversion
While the Bone March is mostly dead, it is not blind to the usefulness of the living.
Human cultists and spies are employed, corrupted by promises of power or immortality. These agents
sabotage, poison, and lure prey to the March, always hoping to avoid the fate they help create.
No city is ever offered mercy; surrender means only a quicker death, a faster harvest, and a place in the
endless legions.
XI. Leadership

Bone March
General Skarn, the Gravefather of the Bone March
General Skarn - The Gravefather
Skarn rose not with fury, but with structure. He does not command-he compels. His silent will pulls corpses
into formation like gravity. No voice, no soul-just endless motion. Skarn marches, and death obeys.
He rules with absolute, wordless authority. None challenge his purpose. All serve the continuation of the
March.

Bone March
"We do not march for victory. We march so we never must stop."
Origin
When the scream of the First Necromancer tore the Veil, the dead did not rise with fury. They rose with
purpose.
From the forgotten battlefields, the bones remembered. They remembered orders. They remembered
discipline.
They rose as marching columns - endless, unbroken, unstoppable.
And they marched because to stop was death. And death had already betrayed them.
At their head stood General Skarn, the Gravefather. The first to rise. The first to step forward.
No prayers. No mercy. Only duty burned into marrow.
Philosophy
The Bone March does not hunger for conquest. It hungers for continuation.
Movement is existence. Stillness is death.
They march endlessly - but they do not march mindlessly.
Necromancer-Lords and Strongholds
Across the scarred world, the Bone March has built fortresses of bone and iron.
- Massive citadels of fused skeletons and siege-wrecked steel.
- Towering keeps, made from mortared skulls and the melted slag of shattered cities.
- Rotting barracks where flesh-husk soldiers rot away while awaiting new masters.
From these fortresses, the Necromancer-Lords reign.
They are undead, or living blasphemers, bound by ancient war glyphs and pacts older than memory.
Each Necromancer commands legions:
- Regiments of armored skeletal knights.

- Siege-beasts stitched from the corpses of horses and giants.
- Undead engineers who build catapults from ribs and cathedrals from shattered vertebrae.
Inside the bone-fortresses, experiments are endless:
- Fresh atrocities crafted from human remains.
- New monstrous undead bred to break sieges or terrorize hidden enclaves.
- Ancient war rituals reanimated into new, even more terrible forms.
The Bone March is not mindless. It is a kingdom of the dead, with its own black politics, its own cruel
hierarchies, its own generals, banners, and black anthems.
Tactics and Warfare
Against isolated villages, the Bone March simply moves through - cutting down and absorbing all into the
endless procession.
But against cities-against armies-they plan.
They surround cities with siege walls made of skeletons.
They dam rivers with piled corpses to flood farmlands and starve defenders.
They collapse mountainsides by marching thousands of soldiers into cliffs until the weight shatters the stone.
Their siege engines are horrors:
- Ram beasts - massive stitched monsters of flesh and steel, hammering gates into splinters.
- Bone trebuchets - launching plague-ridden skulls into enemy strongholds.
- Crawling citadels - mobile siege-towers built from the fused bodies of giants and oxen.
They use fear. They use attrition. They use momentum as a weapon.
Victory is not swift. Victory is not beautiful. Victory is inevitable.
Because the living grow tired. The dead do not.
How They Kill Humans
The Bone March does not gloat. It does not torture. It does not savor.
It simply removes obstacles.
- Soldiers are skewered in mid-charge.

- Villagers are trampled under iron boots.
- Survivors are left crawling, only to be trampled again an hour later.
The living are not enemies. They are future soldiers.
Every corpse left cooling in the sun is another blade for the Bone March.
Atmosphere
When the Bone March approaches:
- The drums are the first sign - skin drums that boom with the heartbeat of a dead god.
- The earth trembles with the weight of a hundred thousand bones grinding in lockstep.
- The sky dims, not from magic, but from the smoke of a hundred conquered cities burning to black.
When the March leaves:
- No screams remain.
- No prayers linger.
Only a trail of freshly harvested death, marching behind them.

Choir of Silence
CHOIR OF SILENCE
I. Origin
When the First Necromancer's scream tore the Veil, not all the dead clawed upward. Some sank inward.
They became hollow-lost souls who could not find their names, ghosts severed from memory, purpose, or
prayer.
They drifted across the shattered fields of Viremyr, minds leaking from their broken bodies, voices slipping
through torn mouths, dreams fading into smoke.
Somewhere, in the ruins of the Echoing Hollow, these broken spirits found each other. Their pain did not heal.
It harmonized. Thus, the Choir of Silence was born.
II. Philosophy
The Choir of Silence believes that language is a lie, memory a shackle, identity a weakness.
They see the First Necromancer's scream not as rage, but as the first hymn-the true prayer, a call to forget, to
erase grief by erasing the self.
They do not destroy the world through fire or blood; they unmake meaning itself, aiming to erase existence
through the absence of story, name, and memory.
III. The Unheard Approach
The Choir does not march in ranks or ride behind banners.
It drifts-a tide of shrouded spirits and hollow dead, floating and shambling through broken fields and sleeping
cities.
Their presence is first felt in the stilling of the air, the hush that falls over birds and bells alike, and the cold
fog that coils between pillars and gravestones.
Relics of forgotten faiths and tarnished bells hang from their tattered forms, chiming with eerie, broken music.
IV. The Act of Unmaking
The Choir's assault is both metaphysical and brutally real.
Their minions do not merely erase memory-they rend flesh and shatter bone:
- Elongated arms end in talons cold as grave-iron, capable of ripping open throats and flaying the living with a
touch.
- Some drift through walls, their presence dimming the world, dragging claws across stone and skin alike,
shredding all that stands in their path.
- Spectral winds rise with their shrieks, flensing flesh from bone, inscribing runes that erase the very names of
the dying.
- Mouths gape impossibly wide, spilling forth banshee wails that flay both body and spirit, leaving behind
hollowed corpses-faces melted away, skin etched with the remnants of lost lullabies.

Choir of Silence
- Towering figures with glowing ribs release waves of psychic force that crush limbs and cave in skulls,
accompanied by silent choruses that paralyze prey with terror.
- Rotting hands wield sacred knives to carve out tongues and eyes, ending spellcasters, leaders, and priests
with fatal precision.
- Chains drag behind drowned revenants, snagging the living and pulling them into spectral waters,
smothering screams with icy hands, leaving only silence and floating corpses.
- Swift, formless horrors swirl through the battlefield, lancing through flesh, slicing limbs and veins before the
victim even understands what is happening.
The Choir attacks in eerie silence and shrieking madness alike, their claws and wails drowning out last words,
their presence scattering defenders in terror and confusion.
V. Instruments of Silence
Wherever the Choir descends, the world is torn and unmade.
Defenders who rally are met not only with psychic erasure, but with physical dismemberment. Those who run
are hunted through fog and ruin, their bodies left shredded and their minds emptied.
The Choir's touch leaves streets slick with blood, corpses piled in grotesque displays, and entire villages
emptied in a single night.
Bells toll to drown out last words; claws silence even the loudest screams.
Shadow-clad specters feed upon the agony of the dying, tearing bodies apart while devouring their most
precious memories.
Scripture-stained robes billow as skeletal revenants mark victims with runes, unraveling body and soul
together into dust and ash.
Chains and veils drag through graveyards and rivers, and even the drowned are not spared: they rise to
smother the living, spreading silence beneath the water.
VI. Fields of Silence
In the aftermath, villages stand empty, homes abandoned, and those who survive wander lost-unable to recall
their own names, faces, or their reason for living.
Graves become pits of blank stone; temples lose their gods; battlefields become meadows where even the
bones have forgotten who fell.
Time itself unravels-clocks and calendars cease, children are born without voices, and no one can remember
what was lost.
Where the Choir lingers, reality thins. Shadows flicker without shape, and the only sound is the distant,
mournful tolling of bells that no one can recall ringing.
VII. Rituals and the Weaving of Silence
The Choir's power is enacted through ritual unmaking:

Choir of Silence
- Entire cities are surrounded by circles of humming wraiths, their memories drained in a slow, irresistible
sorrow. By dawn, the city surrenders, defenders found weeping, unable to recall why they fought.
- Processions enter graveyards and halls of record, erasing inscriptions, oral histories, and birth-names. Ghosts
rise, shrieking, then fall silent as their last tether to the world is cut.
- The Ritual of the Last Word is enacted: victims are offered a final chance to speak their name. Most find
they cannot recall it. Those who do are left as hollow echoes, doomed to wander until even the sound of their
footsteps is forgotten.
VIII. Sanctuaries of Silence
The Choir does not build cities in the living sense. Their strongholds are Sanctuaries of Silence-ruined
cathedrals, forsaken temples, and echoing halls where sound is deadened and memory is unwound.
These places exist in the borderland between life and death, sometimes visible only at dusk or in fog,
sometimes shifting location entirely as the Veil thins.
Sanctuaries are marked by:
- Veiled architecture: Arches and pillars encrusted with relics-cracked bells, prayer wheels, chains of severed
tongues. No banners fly, but shrouds hang heavy, each stitched with prayers that cannot be spoken.
- Mute mosaics and blank tablets: Walls are carved with the impressions of words long erased. Statues line the
corridors, their faces smoothed away by countless ritual touchings.
- Corridors of echoing emptiness: Even footsteps are muffled. The deeper one goes, the more the world loses
color and meaning, until the only sensation is a cold pressure behind the eyes.
- Chambers of ritual: At the heart of every sanctuary lies a hollow chamber where rituals of erasure are
enacted-a place so quiet it seems to swallow thought.
These sanctuaries drift across the world like wounds, sometimes appearing in ruined cities, sometimes in
places of ancient tragedy. To find one is to risk forgetting even that you ever entered.
IX. The Hierarchy of the Nameless
The Choir's structure is an order of absence:
- Silent Lords: At the apex are the Silent Lords-necromancers who have given up name, face, and past to
become living conduits of silence. Their authority is measured not by power, but by what they have
surrendered. They do not speak, but their will is felt in the vibrations of the air, in the silent resonance that
compels the Choir to move, attack, or vanish.
- The Veiled Council: Beneath the Lords, a shifting circle of powerful dead and unbound wraiths serves as a
council. They gather in chambers of darkness, each member wrapped in veils and relics of silence. Their
decisions are rendered by gesture and harmony of breath, never by word.
- Ritual Enforcers: Executors of the Choir's will-undead who have sacrificed tongue, eyes, or memory to
serve. They carry out rituals of erasure, enforce silence, and lead attacks on those who resist.
- The Nameless Host: The bulk of the Choir-mutilated, mindless dead and lost spirits, ever drifting, ever

Choir of Silence
hungering to bring more into the fold of oblivion.
Advancement in the Choir is inverted: to rise, one must lose more of oneself, until only silence remains.
X. The Procession of Initiation
The Choir is ever growing, as new souls are lost to its cause:
- The Initiation: Those who survive a Choir assault, or who are broken in body but not mind, are brought into
sanctuaries. Rituals strip them of name, memory, and voice. Some are left hollow and catatonic, but the
strong-willed become new agents of silence-unbound from the world, able to wound it in turn.
- The Severing: Initiates are ritually marked-tongues cut, eyes veiled, their names carved into stone and then
erased. With each step, they forget more, until they exist only to serve the will of silence.
- The Hollowing: The most gifted are drained further, their identities replaced with the Choir's resonance.
These become enforcers, then councilors, then-if they erase enough-Lords themselves.
No celebration marks these promotions, only deeper stillness and the sense of another thread of meaning
forever cut.
XI. The Necromancers
Within the Choir, necromancers are not rulers, but masters of erasure:
Their magic is the art of forgetting. They do not command armies by voice or threat, but by unmaking the
need for command.
Their spells hum with frequencies that dissolve the boundaries of self, rotting flesh and memory at once.
Rituals are always performed in silence: the severing of tongues, the destruction of books, the scattering of
ashes. They lead processions into conquered cities, turning the living to unthinking thralls, the dead into
vessels of unbeing.
They keep no records or lineages. No Necromancer of the Choir can recall their own true name; even their
titles are forgotten as soon as spoken.
The oldest necromancers have erased so much that even the Veil itself cannot hold their shape; they drift at the
edges of reality, guiding the Choir with the barest thought.
XII. The Choir's Realm
The Choir claims no territory as its own, but where they linger, the world becomes their domain:
Whole cities become sanctuaries, blank and hollowed, filled with fog and silence. Countrysides are marked by
the absence of birds, prayers, and laughter. Even the stars above their processions seem to flicker and fade, as
if memory itself cannot hold them.
There are no maps of the Choir's realm. Where they have passed, there is only emptiness, and a dread certainty
that nothing will ever fill it again.
XIII. The Legacy of Silence

Choir of Silence
After the Choir's passing, the world is not only broken, but erased. Streets run red with blood that no one will
mourn. No record remains of what was lost. No hero is remembered. No song can be sung. The living cannot
even grieve-tears fall for wounds they cannot name, for people they can never remember.
The dead are at last truly dead, for no story binds them to the world.
And above the ruins, drifting on the chill wind, the bells of the Choir ring on-echoes in a world slowly,
inexorably, being unmade.
XIV. Leadership
Maelrith, Choirmaster of Silence
Maelrith the Stillborn, Choirmaster of Silence, is the oldest of the Silent Lords-his veiled form a living wound
in reality. Maelrith has abandoned not just his name, but all memory of his origin. His will is expressed only
through gesture and the silent resonance that bends the Choir to his purpose. Some say he is the last living

Choir of Silence
memory of the First Necromancer's original scream. Where Maelrith moves, sound falters, faces fade, and
nothing-not even grief-remains.

Choir of Silence
"If you cannot name your pain, it cannot bind you."
Origin
When the First Necromancer's scream tore the Veil, not all the dead clawed upward. Some sank inward.
They became hollow.
Lost souls who could not find their names. Ghosts severed from memory, purpose, or prayer.
They drifted across the shattered fields of Viremyr - minds leaking from their broken bodies, voices slipping
through torn mouths, dreams fading into smoke.
And somewhere, in the ruins of the Echoing Hollow, these broken spirits found each other.
Their pain did not heal. It harmonized.
Thus the Choir of Silence was born.
Philosophy
The Choir of Silence believes that language is a lie. Memory is a shackle. Identity is a weakness.
They see the First Necromancer's scream not as rage - but as the first hymn.
The true prayer: A call to forget.
To erase grief by erasing the self.
They do not destroy the world through fire or blood.
They destroy it by unmaking meaning itself.
Necromancers  The Silent Lords
The Choir is guided by Silent Lords - necromancer-kings who have willingly erased their own identities to
better wield the Choir's magic.
Their rituals are silent ceremonies:
- Casting spells by severing tongues.

- Building wards out of forgotten prayers.
- Summoning armies of Unbound Wraiths - spirits too broken to know fear or mercy.
A Silent Lord does not speak commands. They hum them - in deep, reverberating notes that cause:
- Swords to rust.
- Shields to crumble.
- Soldiers to forget why they raised their blades at all.
Their magic targets names, memories, languages. Once erased, a soldier is no longer a threat.
How They Kill Humans
They do not cut. They do not burn.
They unmake.
The Choir attacks the soul first:
- A man lifts his sword, then forgets why he is fighting.
- A woman calls for her child, and forgets the child's name.
- A king gives a final speech - but only dust falls from his mouth.
When the Choir reaches a village:
- Walls collapse not from siege, but from the loss of belief that walls ever mattered.
- Food spoils in kitchens because the concept of hunger itself is wiped away.
- Families weep for loved ones they cannot remember.
Those who survive physically are often found:
- Sitting catatonic in burned fields.
- Whispering forgotten words into the dirt.
- Hollow-eyed, forgetting even how to breathe.
Resistance is almost impossible.
How do you fight when you cannot remember why you are fighting?
Environment and Atmosphere
Before the Choir arrives:
- The air stills.

- The birds fall silent.
- The bells crack and crumble without being touched.
You feel it before you see it:
- A humming behind your ribs.
- A pressure behind your eyes.
- A sense that something important is slipping away - but you cannot name it.
When the Choir moves through a city:
- The statues lose their faces.
- The books lose their words.
- The graves lose their names.
Even the dead they leave behind are not whole:
- Corpses whose faces rot first.
- Bodies without identities, wandering until their feet give out.
The Choir does not conquer.
It erases.
Tactics and Warfare
They do not build siege engines. They do not storm walls.
They unmake defenses through psychic erosion:
- Rituals that erase enemy banners, causing armies to forget who they serve.
- Hexes that cause generals to forget the meaning of "retreat" or "attack."
- Silent hymns that cause towns to dissolve into wandering herds of hollowed-out survivors.
The Choir's greatest victories are often the quietest:
- A castle abandoned without a fight.
- A temple collapsing into dust without a prayer.
- A king who slits his own throat because he no longer remembers why he rules.

Cult of the Withered Flame
CULT OF THE WITHERED FLAME
I. The Procession of Fire
The Cult of the Withered Flame does not conquer by steel or shadow. It advances as a procession of fire and
agony. The air ahead of their march is suffused with heat and incense; the ground beneath their feet is
blackened and warm, footprints seared into the earth. At the vanguard walk the burned and blistered, flesh
fused to armor, eyes burning with faith and pain. Children of ash, pyre-bound knights, and fire-scoured
prophets wail out hymns that echo across scorched fields.
There is no mercy in their advance-only the conviction that all must burn to be made holy.
II. The Burning of Cities
Wherever the Cult arrives, they transform land and people alike. Villages are surrounded, and every home
becomes a pyre. Families are dragged out, bound to stakes, and offered to the flames as "gifts to the ash gods."
Infants are held up in ritual, their cries swallowed by chanting cultists and the roar of fire.
The Cult does not differentiate between enemy and convert. Those who resist are burned screaming. Those
who surrender are burned quietly, their bodies turned to ash, their souls sent upward in columns of smoke.
After a city falls:
- Only charred bones remain, scattered in fields of cooling ash.
- Streets run with melted fat, blood boiled away in the blaze.
- The sky above glows red, veiled by drifting embers.
- The silence is broken only by the hiss of dying coals and the distant, ceaseless prayers of the faithful.
III. The Undead of Fire
The Cult's armies are raised not from cold graves, but from the heart of cremation pits:
- Burning knights stalk the battlefield, their armor fused to scorched flesh, trailing gouts of fire and molten
bone.
- Ashborn children wander as living torches, their laughter shrill and mindless, igniting all they touch.
- Blistered heralds lead charges-when slain, they erupt into storms of embers, burning friend and foe alike.
All undead in the Cult's thrall are in some state of burning, their agony unending and sacred. To the Cult, pain
is prayer, and fire is the only true absolution.
IV. Temples and Strongholds
The Cult builds their temples from the bones of the burned, each altar containing the skull of a traitor-its fire
never dying, its teeth whispering endless confession. Their strongholds rise from the ashen ground of
Emberdeep, wreathed in pillars of smoke and crowned with black iron and glass, forever glowing with inner
flame.
Inside, Ashwright necromancers lead rites beneath rivers of molten stone. Corridors are lined with scorched

Cult of the Withered Flame
reliquaries-brands, hooks, and branding irons still hot from use. The air is thick with incense, ash, and the
stink of burning flesh.
V. Hierarchy of Flame
Ashen Pyrexis stands at the center-a living pyre, a priest consumed and reborn by fire. He speaks only in
screams, his presence boiling the air, his body forever leaking cinders and flame.
Ashwrights-necromancer-priests-conduct the rituals of burning, branding the living, raising the dead from fire,
and selecting the next victims for sacrifice.
Cinderbound-the burned faithful-serve as enforcers and torchbearers, bringing the sacred fire to new lands and
ensuring no flesh escapes the flame.
Devotion is measured by scars. Status is bought with layers of burned flesh. The highest among them are
nearly unrecognizable-living skeletons clad in glowing iron and embers, forever chanting prayers to the ash
gods.
VI. The Ritual of Purification
Every conquest is followed by the Ritual of Purification:
- The dead are piled high and set alight, their smoke believed to carry their souls to the ash gods.
- Survivors are bound, branded, and either immolated in public spectacle or forced to inhale sacred embers and
become undead-reborn in flame.
- The ashes of each victim are collected and used to consecrate new weapons, armor, and even food.
No body is left to rot. Nothing is allowed to rest. Everything becomes fuel for the Godpyre.
VII. The Godpyre and Their Dream
The Cult dreams of a world made clean by fire-a Godpyre so vast it will consume every city, every corpse, and
every soul. Only then, they believe, will the ash gods descend and lift their faithful from the cinders into a new
world.
Until then, every day is a new offering. Every death is a prayer. Every city burned is a step toward sacred
annihilation.
VIII. The Ashlands
Wherever the Cult lingers, the land itself is warped:
- Trees become pillars of charcoal, forever burning but never consumed.
- Rivers run black with soot and oily smoke.
- The ground is warm to the touch, littered with brittle bones and the rusted iron of countless pyres.
- Even the wind tastes of fire and pain.
At night, Emberdeep glows against the horizon-an eternal wound in the world, a warning to all who would
deny the sanctity of flame.

Cult of the Withered Flame
IX. The Fires of War
The Cult of the Withered Flame wages war as a living inferno. They do not encircle their enemies-they engulf
them. Every advance is an act of combustion. Their tactics are brutal and relentless, fueled by a faith that
hungers for more fuel.
When battle is joined, the ground itself becomes a weapon:
- Pyres are lit in advance, choking the air with black smoke and burning incense that stings the eyes and lungs
of all who resist.
- The vanguard surges forward-burned warriors wielding brands, flaming chains, and hooks torn from ancient
altars.
- The dead are driven ahead, their bodies burning but never falling, each blow from their charred limbs leaving
cinders and molten blood on the ground.
The Cult's battle cries are screams and prayers, echoed by the crackle of living flames.
Their necromancers-Ashwrights-stand at the rear, hurling fire-slick curses, summoning whirling embers, and
resurrecting the fallen in sheets of holy flame. Those struck down by cultists often rise again in moments, their
flesh ignited, their minds lost to the pain.
The cult employs fire as both sword and shield: rivers of burning oil, walls of living flame, and clouds of
ember-laden ash that blind, choke, and sear.
The Ashborn children dart through the chaos, setting foes ablaze with their touch, their laughter echoing over
the din of slaughter.
Defenders find their lines breaking-not from fear, but from heat and smoke.
Armor glows red-hot, shields burst into flame, and weapons splinter as ash and cinder corrode iron and wood
alike. Any who fall are dragged back by the Cinderbound, their bodies sacrificed to the nearest pyre, so that
none may escape the holy conflagration.
To face the Cult in battle is to feel the world shrinking to heat, pain, and fire. Screams vanish into smoke, and
hope is devoured in the flames.
X. Aftermath of Battle
When the fires fade, the battlefield is a field of charcoal and brittle bone. Nothing green survives. Armor is
melted to slag, weapons warped and fused. There are no corpses, only blackened remnants and the constant,
swirling drift of ash.
Above it all, the cult marches onward, singing prayers to their ash gods, leaving only a smoldering memory
behind.
XI. The Legacy of Ash
Where the Cult has passed, there are no ghosts-only ashes drifting on the wind. No names carved on stones,
only scorched earth and burned memories. The world grows emptier and hotter in their wake, as if the air itself

Cult of the Withered Flame
is afraid to linger where the withered flame still flickers.
XII. Leadership
Ashen Pyrexis, Living Pyre of the Withered Flame
Ashen Pyrexis stands at the center-a living pyre, a priest consumed and reborn by fire. His screams boil the
air, his body endlessly sheds cinders and flame. He is the first to burn and the last to be extinguished, leading
the Cult toward its final Godpyre. Where he passes, nothing remains but ash, agony, and the memory of holy
fire.

Cult of the Withered Flame
"Our gods are ash. We burn to be closer to them."
Origin
When the scream of the First Necromancer tore the Veil, the world cracked.
Some heard sorrow. Some heard command. The Cult of the Withered Flame heard invitation.
From the molten valleys of Emberdeep, they crawled into the light - not as men, not as corpses, but as burned
things that would not die.
The first cultists were not necromancers. They were penitents. Fanatics. Scorch-eyed prophets who believed
the scream was a divine flame - not of destruction, but of truth.
They gathered the dead and burned them. Then they burned the living. Then themselves.
And still they moved. Still they rose.
Because the fire did not consume them. It converted them.
Philosophy
To the Cult, undeath is impure until it has been cleansed in agony.
They believe pain is a prayer. Fire is mercy. And ash is the only material worthy of godhood.
The Cult believes the First Necromancers scream did not raise the dead. It ignited them. It burned the line
between life and death.
Their goal is the Godpyre - a world-encompassing blaze. Every city a torch. Every corpse a candle. Every soul
a spark.
Only when all of Viremyr has burned will they walk, ash-covered and holy, into the next world.
Their Leader  Ashen Pyrexis
He is not a king. Not a general.
He is a fire given form.

Once a necromancer-priest in the ashlands, Pyrexis offered himself to the scream. He climbed into a burning
pit during ritual and came out hollow, his bones charred black, his lungs filled with flame.
He no longer speaks. He screams - and the flame listens.
His body leaks cinders. His presence boils the air. His eyes glow like burning coal inside a cracked skull.
Necromancers and Armies
The Cult is led by burned necromancers called Ashwrights.
Their undead are not rotting - they are burning:
- Cinderbound knights, still aflame, howling with every step.
- Ashborn children, turned into wailing torches.
- Blistered heralds, who explode into firestorms upon death.
They raise their armies from cremation pits, not graves.
In Emberdeep, they build temples made from scorched bones. Each altar contains the skull of a traitor, still
whispering as the fire inside it never dies.
How They Kill Humans
The Cult believes that dying in fire is sacred.
They do not just kill. They burn.
- Families are dragged from homes and nailed to wooden stakes.
- Infants are held up to flame as offerings.
- Survivors are branded and raised as ash-touched undead.
Those who resist are burned screaming.
Those who surrender are burned quietly.
Atmosphere
The air stinks of scorched hair and incense.
The ground is always warm beneath their feet. The sky above Emberdeep glows red.
Where the Cult passes:

- The land becomes ash fields.
- The dead become flames that walk.
- The living become kindling.
They leave no bodies.
Only bones blackened into brittle memory.
Only footprints seared into the stone.
Only smoke.
