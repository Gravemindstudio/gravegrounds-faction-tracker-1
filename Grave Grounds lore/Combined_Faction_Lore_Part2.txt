Dawnflame Order
DAWNFLAME ORDER
"If it breathes beyond its time, let fire teach it truth."
Origin
Born from shattered temples, collapsing kingdoms, and the final desperate armies of humanity, the
Dawnflame Order was forged in purity by flame.
They do not seek peace. They do not seek mercy. They do not seek to rebuild. They seek cleansing.
Philosophy
The Dawnflame believes undeath is the greatest blasphemy. It is an insult to life. A curse upon the soul. A
shadow that must be burned away, no matter the cost.
They worship no gods now. Only flame. Only righteous fury.
They do not mourn the dead. They burn them. To free them. To prevent their return.
Even a child, if suspected of plague or corruption, will be cast to the pyre.
"They are not saints. They are executioners."
To the innocent, harsh protectors. To the guilty, fire incarnate.
They have burned villages on rumor. Killed children to save cities.
They do not fear the Hollow Redeemed. But they do not trust them.
They strike even the living if they refuse to burn the dead.
Structure and Order
The Dawnflame is a scattered brotherhood, linked by oaths and fire. Their ranks include:
- Pyre-Chaplains: fire-priests who recite the Flame Litanies.
- Inquisitors: commanders who root out undead corruption.
- Burnwrights: black-armored fanatics with flamethrowers and brands.
- Sunwardens: elite warriors clad in charred gold.
Each stronghold is a pyre-fort-part sanctuary, part crematorium, part weapon.
Weapons and Tactics
They burn.
- Necromancers are immolated alive.
- Undead are pinned in flame-traps.
- Suspected humans are purified without trial.
Their weapons include:
- Sunflasks: grenades of burning oils.
- Pyreblades: flaming swords.

Dawnflame Order
- Fire-chains: spiked whips.
- Cleansing Pillars: fixed flamethrowers for mass purges.
They burn first. They ask never.
They use:
- Preemptive strikes.
- City-wide purges.
- Firewalls to isolate zones.
- Sunstrike Rites-bombardments of flame on corrupted strongholds.
They know they will die out. But while one torch burns, undeath will fear the flame.
Leadership
High Inquisitor Varaxis, the Unyielding Flame

Dawnflame Order
High Inquisitor Varaxis, the Unyielding Flame
A tall, battle-scarred man with iron-gray hair and a gaze like molten steel. His face is weathered by decades of
conflict, etched with lines of resolve and loss. He wears the blackened plate of the Dawnflame Order,
emblazoned with a crimson flame-a symbol feared by the dead and revered by the living. In his gauntleted fist,
he wields the legendary sword Cinderwake, its blade burning with a living fire that never gutters.
Varaxis has led the Dawnflame Order for over three decades, shaping its warriors and priests into the last true
shield between Solace and oblivion. He is both commander and judge, general and spiritual father, known for
his fierce devotion to the living and his utter intolerance for weakness or corruption.
He has never shied from the front lines; tales tell of him holding the gates of Solace alone against a tide of
Bone March undead, or striding through Swarm-infected fields with Cinderwake's flame cleansing all before
him.
Varaxis is loved and feared in equal measure. To the people of Solace, he is the Unyielding Flame-unyielding
in justice, unyielding in sacrifice, unyielding in the memory of every loss. To his enemies, his name is a curse:
necromancers tell their apprentices, "Do not speak of Varaxis, or the flame will find you."
He believes hope is forged, not found. Mercy is for the living; to the undead and the Forsaken, there can be
only fire. In private, it's whispered that he keeps a list of every soul lost under his watch, reciting their names
before every battle.
Varaxis is known for:
- Absolute loyalty to his Order and city.
- No tolerance for necromancy or those who traffic with the enemy.
- Strict but fair discipline-those who falter are punished, but those who fight are remembered.
- Secret sorrow: Some say the only time he weeps is when a Hollow Redeemed falls-though he has never
spoken a word of forgiveness.
Signature Relic: Cinderwake
The sword Cinderwake is both torch and blade, its fire fueled by ancient rites and bound souls of fallen
Dawnflame. It is said to burn hottest in the presence of betrayal, and in Varaxis's hand, it never dims.
Legends and Rumors
It's whispered that Varaxis has walked into the deepest crypts and returned alone, covered in ash, with no
memory of what transpired.
Some say he cannot die until Solace is safe.
Others believe he is already partially bound to the fire-a living vessel for the city's last hope.

"Stand with me. Stand with the flame. As long as we burn, the night will never win."

Solace and the Valley: Lore Compendium
The Solace Valley: The Last Patchwork
Solace is not just a single city, but the ragged heart of a battered region—a shallow, mist-wrapped valley dotted with ruined outposts, struggling hamlets, and stubborn patches of farm fields. Crops are strange and stunted but grow in the silt left behind by a retreating glacier. In the shadows of old fortresses and broken watchtowers, villagers work together to hold back the undead—barely.

Life in the Solace Valley
The City of Solace
Still the center. A crumbling fortress-town on a low hill, surrounded by makeshift walls and rings of torchlight. People from outlying farms come here to trade, worship, and beg protection. Its markets buzz (quietly), and its inns are places of rumor, music, and hard comfort.

Outlying Hamlets
Clusters of mud-and-stone houses, sometimes nothing more than a crossroads and a well. Each hamlet has its own warden (half farmer, half militia captain), a family of livestock, a shrine, and a few fields of gray wheat, blight-resistant root vegetables, and “lantern gourds” that give off a faint light.

Sample Names: Ashwick, Candlefield, Red Hollow, Lantern’s Rest, Gloamstead.

Defenses: Watchtowers, beacon fires, and small stone chapels that double as refuges.

Farm Fields
Scarred but alive. Farmers use bone-plows pulled by lean oxen, sow fields in circles around old rune-stones for luck. At night, the fields glow faintly—protective glyphs burned into the soil to keep out the restless dead.

Crops: Dark potatoes, bitter beans, lantern gourds, and fungal groves under burned-out trees.

Labor: Everyone farms, even city-dwellers have “adopted rows.”

Dangers: Sometimes a scarecrow goes missing, or strange tracks appear after midnight.

Small Towns
A handful of towns persist on the valley’s edge—trade posts, mining camps, old villages holding out with grim determination. Every town has a Waking Bell—rung if undead are seen, summoning every able hand to arms.

Solace – The Last City
Solace is a city born of desperation, built atop the bones of an older world. Its high hill overlooks patchwork fields and scattered hamlets. Once, it was a quiet trade town; now it is a fortress, surrounded by walls both ancient and new.

The Walls
Jagged circles of salvaged stone, broken statues, and bricks pressed from ashes. New ramparts bristle with torch-poles, iron spikes, and chalk-scrawled runes. Watchtowers at the cardinal points, each with a battered bell ready to ring at the first sign of trouble. Gates are double-barred at night; no one leaves after dusk unless they have a death wish—or a lantern blessed by the priests.

Districts of Solace
Oldheart: The city center, wide streets, the Hall of Echoes (a half-ruined amphitheater).
Ember’s Edge: Western district of blacksmiths, tanners, pyre-workers. Ash drifts in the air.
Lantern Row: Markets cling to life under canopies. Lanterns and charms hang everywhere.
Low Quarter: Crooked houses, packed with families from lost villages. Laundry hangs from windows.
The Barricade: Southern wall, home to defenders, militia, and those training the next generation.

Daily Life
Morning: The Dawn Bell clangs; farmers and foragers trickle in.

Midday: Lantern Row is busy with news and barter.

Afternoon: Drills in the Barricade, repairs to walls, lessons in Oldheart.

Evening: Gates locked, torchlight flickers, families share quiet meals.

Rituals and Customs
Pyre Rites: The dead are cremated in Ember’s Edge, ashes made into bricks to reinforce the city.

Lantern Vigils: Each month, lanterns are hung along the main road—one for every lost soul.

Stone Stories: Names of the lost carved into a standing stone in Oldheart. Some say it hums with memory.

People of Solace
Tough, practical, fiercely loyal. The young learn to read, fight, and plant. The old are respected for their memories. Hope is rare, courage is common.

Atmosphere
At sunset, lanterns glow across Solace—tiny islands of light in a sea of deepening shadow. Children listen to stories behind closed doors; warning bells echo from the walls.

Daily Life in Solace – Vignettes
The Dawn Bell:
Every morning, a volunteer climbs the broken steeple and strikes the rusted bell frame. The sound is thin but marks survival.

Bread of Ash:
Gray, flat, and bitter—made from fungus flour and root mash. On good days, crusts are left for ghosts.

Lantern Vigil:
Once each month, the city gathers in silence, holding lanterns for the lost. If a lantern gutters out, nearby people relight it, whispering the dead’s name.

School of Stones:
Children first learn glyphs for warning and warding. Each carries a “grave stone” for protection.

Mourning Market:
At dusk, traders gather by the clocktower to barter. Stories are currency; the old woman with one eye sells “lost memories.”

Hollow Redeemed Patrol:
Silent, heads bowed, the Redeemed walk the perimeter nightly. If a child is lost, they return it home. No words, only actions.

Pyre Rites:
No burials—only pyres. Ashes are made into bricks for city walls.

Midnight Games:
Children play the “Silent Game,” sneaking from shadow to shadow, pretending to be undead. Laughter, rare and precious, echoes in the alleys.

Ashwine:
A rare treat—fermented root sap, burning but welcome on festival nights.

The Last Song:
Sometimes, at dusk, a masked singer appears in the Hall of Echoes, singing a new song each time. No one knows if it’s a ghost or a survivor. All listen.

Defending Against the Factions
The Dawnflame Order
The backbone of human survival: warriors, priests, and purifiers.

Pyre Walls: Defensive lines of enchanted flame.

Ritual Burning: All dead are cremated, all suspected infection purged with fire.

Sunforged Arms: Blessed swords, pikes, and armor.

Flame Litanies: Prayers and battle-songs to strengthen defenders.

Vigilant Purity: Every home keeps a warning torch and trained youth.

Bone March
Massed Walls: Reinforced, often lined with blessed spikes and fire traps.

Ambush Tactics: Draw the March into kill-zones lit with flame.

Severing Glyphs: Runic traps break the cohesion of undead armies.

Gravewrought Court
Warding Stones: Fields and homes ringed with soul-warding runes.

Nightwatch: No one is invited in after sundown.

Order Investigation: All signs of Court influence are rooted out swiftly.

Swarm of the Mireborn
Firebreaks: Crops planted in separated, burned lines.

Herb Rituals: Burning protective herbs, lantern gourds to mark safe ground.

Quick Purges: Immediate burning of infected areas.

Choir of Silence
Anchor Songs: Bells and chants at dawn and dusk to anchor memory.

Memory Tokens: Lockets or stones with names and family history.

Priestly Rites: Exorcists restore memory and identity after attacks.

The Hollow Redeemed: Hated, Unprotected, and Silent
The Hollow Redeemed are undead, spirits, monsters, and repentant necromancers who turned against the Gorebound Legion or were summoned after its fall. They fight for Solace and the valley, but their existence is marked by sorrow and silence.

No Protection:
There is no law shielding the Redeemed. When attacked or abused, they do not defend themselves or speak—they simply endure, even unto destruction.

Scapegoats:
Blamed for disasters, deaths, or breaches. Mobs sometimes kill a Redeemed out of fear or rage. They never fight back.

Martyrs:
Volunteer for the most dangerous watches, believing their pain or death is penance.

Secret Remorse:
Rarely, grateful citizens leave offerings where a Redeemed fell, but public sympathy is rare and dangerous.

No Retaliation:
Never in living memory has a Redeemed harmed a human, even in self-defense. Their silence makes them both pitiable and alien.

Silent Communication
The Hollow Redeemed never speak.

They communicate only through gestures: pointing, nodding, or simply completing a task.

When abused or killed, they do not protest or beg.

Their intentions are often misunderstood—a pointed finger might mean warning, but is often read as a curse.

Small acts of silent kindness are common—a lost toy returned, a fence mended, a fire quietly put out.

Atmosphere:
When a Redeemed passes, doors are closed and children called inside. Sometimes, after a Redeemed points to a problem, the city is saved; sometimes, their gestures are ignored until it’s too late.

Urban Legends:

“If a Redeemed points at your door, death will visit before the next moon.”

“A Redeemed helps only at a cost—never to themselves, always for another.”

“The Redeemed who help you will pay a price, but never ask for reward.”

Sample Day in the Valley
Morning mist hides the scarecrows, each carved with runes. Chickens peck at black earth, a sleepy dog guards the yard. The warden calls everyone to work—fields need weeding, beacon fire needs tending.
Children run to the city with lantern gourds. By noon, a merchant trades iron nails for grave mushrooms. At dusk, all gather for bread, beans, stew, and hope.
After nightfall, the Hollow Redeemed patrol passes, silent as ghosts. The doors stay closed. Someone whispers a prayer for forgiveness—or for protection.

 The Council of the Forsaken
Who They Were
In the desperate decades after the Veil was shattered, when every living soul clung to hope or faith, there existed a conclave of powerful wizards, scholars, and rune-masters across the valley.
They were known as the Council of Dawnsages—once humanity’s greatest magical minds, trusted to find a way to reverse or contain undeath.

The Betrayal
Over time, fear and ambition poisoned the Council. Some saw necromancy as a path to survival—or domination.
A core group turned traitor, each seeking out one of the five undead factions:

Some bargained with Gravewrought nobles, offering knowledge of warding glyphs for a place at court.

Others marched to the Bone March, seeking immortality and power over death itself.

Still others entered the fetid swamps to join the Swarm, trading their minds for mastery over rot and rebirth.

One or two vanished into haunted ruins, seduced by the Choir’s promise of remaking the mind and soul.

And a bitter former fire-priest, driven by anger and loss, was the first living human to pledge themselves to the Cult of the Withered Flame—a faction of ash, blight, and hunger for burning everything that once was.

Each became a high necromancer, general, or warlord—a “First of the Forsaken”—using their genius to strengthen their chosen faction and deepen the world’s doom.

Legacy
Children’s Warning:
“Never trust the wise who keep secrets. Their hearts are already half-dead.”

The Living’s Shame:
Some family lines are rumored to carry “Forsaken blood,” forever marked by suspicion and misfortune.

Faction Influence:
The Forsaken’s betrayals are why the Bone March adapts, why the Court’s magic breaks old wards, and why the Swarm and Choir grow ever more cunning. The Cult of the Withered Flame, once dismissed as madmen, now wields true apocalyptic magic thanks to its human turncoat.

Known Forsaken (Rumored):
Maltheon the Bonewright:
Builder of the city’s walls, now a general of bone, shaping legions to breach every defense he once designed.

Lady Syrene of the Veil:
Once a healer, now the Gravewrought Court’s mistress of soul-theft and memory erasure.

Erekh the Mirebound:
A life-scholar turned living plague, master of the Swarm’s rot and rebirth.

The Ashen Chorister:
A bard drawn to forbidden secrets, orchestrates the Choir’s haunting silences.

The Emberbrand:
Former priest of flame, now high necromancer of the Cult of the Withered Flame—his fire burns cold, leaving nothing but cinders and despair.

Current Fears & Plots
The Forsaken are believed to still send spies and whispers to Solace, luring new traitors to their ranks.

Only a union of Hollow Redeemed and the bravest of the living might stand a chance against their combined power.

Artifacts and tomes created by the Forsaken resurface in black markets, bringing curses and unrest wherever they appear.
