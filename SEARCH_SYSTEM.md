## How It Works

### Backend API Endpoints

- `GET /api/users/faction/:faction` - Get all users in a specific faction
- `GET /api/users/recent` - Get recently active users
- `PUT /api/users/activity` - Update user's last activity timestamp

### Database Changes

- Added `searchable_username` column for better search performance

### Frontend Components
